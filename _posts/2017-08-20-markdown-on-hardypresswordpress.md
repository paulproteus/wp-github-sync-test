Today I installed a Markdown addon into WordPress.

Here's what I've learned.

- Using this one that I picked, gosh what's the name I already forgot, has a nice preview window.

- It has a strange copy-paste upload image feature, which I'm going to hereby test.

Oh my god that was incredible. Except for the fact that it chose an admin URL for the image.
